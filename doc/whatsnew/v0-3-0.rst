Bug fixes
#########

* The timeincrement attribute of the model is not set to one anymore.
    In earlier versions the timeincrement was set to one by default. This was a
    problem if a wrong time index was passed. In that case the timeincrement
    was set to one without a warning. Now an error is raised if no
    timeincrement or valid time index is found
    (`Issue #549 <https://github.com/oemof/oemof/issues/549>`_).

Testing
#######

* Automatic test coverage control was implemented. Now a PR will not be
    accepted if it decreases the test coverage.
* Test coverage was increased to over 90%. A badge was added to the
    `oemof github page <https://github.com/oemof/oemof>`_ that shows the
    actual test coverage.
