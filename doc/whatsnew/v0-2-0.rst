v0.2.0 ()
++++++++++++++++++++++++++


API changes
###########

* Rename `NodesFromCSV` function to `nodes_from_csv`
* Replace LinearTransformer and LinearN1Transformer classes with one Transformer class. The new class has n inputs and n outputs. Please note that the definition of the conversion factors has changed. See the new docstring to avoid errors (`Issue #351 <https://github.com/oemof/oemof/issues/351>`_).
* Rename OperationalModel to Model

New features
############

* Add new outputlib module to analyse and and plot optimization results.
  All decision variables of a Node are now collected automatically which
  enables an easier development of custom components within the oemof logic.
  See examples for usage!
* A new component `GenericCHP` allows an accurate modelling of different CHP
  types including combined-cycle plant.
* Add an outputlib module to draw and plot energy system graphs using networkx.
* Sort columns of result dataframe lexicographically.
* It's now possible to modify a :class:`node <oemof.network.Node>`'s
  :attr:`inputs <oemof.network.Node.inputs>` and `outputs
  <oemof.network.Node.outputs>` by inserting and removing :class:`node
  <oemof.network.Node>`s to and from the correspoding dictionaries.
  :attr:`Outputs <oemof.network.Node.outputs>` where already working
  previously, but due to an implementation quirk, :attr:`inputs
  <oemof.network.Node.inputs>` did not behave as expected. This is now fixed.
