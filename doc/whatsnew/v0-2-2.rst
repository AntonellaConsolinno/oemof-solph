API changes
###########



New features
############
* We added a new attribute `existing` to the `solph.options.Investement` class.
  It will now be possible to run investment optimization based on already
  installed capacity of a component.
  Take a look on :ref:`investment_mode_label` for usage of this option.
  (`Issue #489 <https://github.com/oemof/oemof/issues/489>`_).

* Investement variables for the capacity and the flows are now decoupled to
  enable more flexibility. It is possible to couple the flows to the capacity,
  the flows to itself or to not couple anything. Added attribute: 
  'invest_relation_input_output_power'. Scalar that indicates the input power ratio 
  compared to the output power ratio.

Bug fixes
#########

* Fix file extension check to dump a graph correctly as .graphml-file
* The full constraint set of the ExtractionTurbineCHP class was only build for
  one object. If more than one object was present the input/output constraint
  was missing. This leads to wrong results.
* In the solph constraints module the emission constraint did not include
  the timeincrement form the model which has now be fixed.
