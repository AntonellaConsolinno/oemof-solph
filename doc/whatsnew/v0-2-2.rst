v0.2.2 ()
++++++++++++++++++++++++++


API changes

New features
############
* We added a new attribute `existing` to the `solph.options.Investement` class.
  It will now be possible to run investment optimization based on already
  installed capacity of a component.
  Take a look on :ref:`investment_mode_label` for usage of this option.
  (`Issue #489 <https://github.com/oemof/oemof/issues/489>`_).

* Investement variables for the capacity and the flows are now decoupled to
  enable more flexibility. It is possible to couple the flows to the capacity,
  the flows to itself or to not couple anything. The newly added attributes
  `invest_relation_input_output`, `invest_relation_input_capacity` and
  `invest_relation_output_capacity` replace the existing attributes
  `nominal_input_capacity_ratio` and `nominal_input_capacity_ratio` for the
  investment mode. In case of the dispatch mode one should use the
  `nominal_value` of the Flow classes. The attributes
  `nominal_input_capacity_ratio` and `nominal_input_capacity_ratio` will be
  removed in v0.3.0. Please adapt your application to avoid problems in the
  future (`Issue #480 <https://github.com/oemof/oemof/issues/480>`_).

* An option was added to decouple the last and the first time step of the storage
  capacity. At the moment the last time step has always the same value as the first.

Bug fixes
#########

* Fix file extension check to dump a graph correctly as .graphml-file
* The full constraint set of the ExtractionTurbineCHP class was only build for
  one object. If more than one object was present the input/output constraint
  was missing. This leads to wrong results.
* In the solph constraints module the emission constraint did not include
  the timeincrement form the model which has now be fixed.
