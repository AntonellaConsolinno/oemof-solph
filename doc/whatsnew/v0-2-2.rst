New features
############

* Investement variables for the capacity and the flows are now decoupled to
enable more flexibility. It is possible to couple the flows to the capacity,
the flows to itself or to not couple anything. Added attribute: 
'invest_relation_input_output_power'. Scalar that indicates the input power ratio 
compared to the output power ratio.

Bug fixes
#########

* Fix file extension check to dump a graph correctly as .graphml-file
* The full constraint set of the ExtractionTurbineCHP class was only build for
 one object. If more than one object was present the input/output constraint
 was missing. This leads to wrong results.
