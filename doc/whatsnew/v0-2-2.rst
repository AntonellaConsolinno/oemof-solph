API changes
###########



New features
############

* We now have experimental support for deserializing an energy system from a
  tabular `data package <https://frictionlessdata.io/data-packages/>`_. Since
  we have to extend the datapackage format a bit, the specification is not yet
  finalized and documentation as well as tests range from sparse to
  nonexistent. But anyone who wishes to help with the code is welcome to check
  it out in the :mod:`datapackage <oemof.tools.datapackage>` module.

Bug fixes
#########

* Fix file extension check to dump a graph correctly as .graphml-file
* The full constraint set of the ExtractionTurbineCHP class was only build for
  one object. If more than one object was present the input/output constraint
  was missing. This leads to wrong results.
* In the solph constraints module the emission constraint did not include
  the timeincrement from the model which has now be fixed.
