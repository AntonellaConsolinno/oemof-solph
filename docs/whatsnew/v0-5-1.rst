* The component `Transformer` is renamed to `Converter`.
  When people hear "transformer", they think of electrical devices.
  However, the Transformer is neither meant to be (only) electrical
  nor bidirectional (as electrical transformers typically are).
  Thus, the more generic term "converter" is now used.
  (Note that we always had the argument "conversion_factor".)
