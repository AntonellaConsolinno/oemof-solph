----------


API changes
###########

* Change investment for experimental :class:`oemof.solph.components.experimental._sink_dsm.SinkDSM`: Remove
  obsolete parameters `flex_share_down` and `flex_share_up`.

New features
############

* Add option to run multi-period (dynamic) investment models with oemof.solph as an experimental feature:
    * You can change from standard model to multi-period model by defining `multi_period=True`
      as attribute of your energy system. Be aware that it is experimental as of now.
    * Add attributes `multi_period` and `periods` and `fred` to :class:`oemof.solph._energy_system.EnergySystem`.
    * Introduce new Pyomo Sets `PERIODS` and `TIMEINDEX` in :class:`oemof.solph.models.Model`.
    * Index all investment-related variables with `PERIODS` and flow variable with `TIMEINDEX`.
    * Add lifetime tracking for investment options by introducing the attributes `lifetime` and `age`.
    * Add new investment-related variables `total` holding the total capacity, `old` holding capacity
      to be decommissioned, `old_exo` (for exogenous) holding existing capacity to be decommissioned and
      `old_end` holding model-endogenously installed capacity to be decommissioned after its lifetime.
    * Include discounting and calculating annuities in the objective function terms. Introduce attribute `discount_rate`
      of :class:`oemof.solph.models.Model` and `interest_rate` for individual investment objects (options.Investment).
