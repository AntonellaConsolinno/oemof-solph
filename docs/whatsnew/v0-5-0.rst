v0.5.0
------


API changes
###########

* Parts of the energy system graph are now clearly structured into `buses`, `components`, and `flows`.
* Public and private API are be more distinguished now. ('_' signifies private, public API is defined in init files.)
* Started API for distinct `Flow`, `InvestmentFlow`, and `NonConvexFlow`.
* Experimental code is now sitting in submodules called `experimental` (replaces "custom").



New features
############

* Add `inactivity_costs` as an option for `NonConvexFlow`.
* Add option to run multi-period (dynamic) investment models with oemof.solph as an experimental feature:
    * You can change from standard model to multi-period model by defining `multi_period=True`
      as attribute of your energy system. Be aware that it is experimental as of now.
    * Introduce new Pyomo Sets `PERIODS` and `TIMEINDEX` in :class:`oemof.solph.models.Model`.
    * Index all investment-related variables with `PERIODS` and flow variable with `TIMEINDEX`.
    * Add lifetime tracking for investment options by introducing the attributes `lifetime` and `age`.
    * Add new investment-related variables `total` holding the total capacity, `old` holding capacity
      to be decommissioned, `old_exo` (for exogenous) holding existing capacity to be decommissioned and
      `old_end` holding model-endogenously installed capacity to be decommissioned after its lifetime.
    * Include discounting and calculating annuities in the objective function terms. Introduce attribute `discount_rate`
      of :class:`oemof.solph.models.Model` and `interest_rate` for individual investment objects (options.Investment).
